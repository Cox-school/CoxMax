Dear Reader,

Sophos is a sad, educational play virus. 
The owners of this trash, annoying, and non-effecting virus, have put this program under MIT. 
Search "MIT" if you don't know it. Do not use this program on a computer that you do not want to shut down and/or don't have permsion to use. 
Feel free to edit and optimize this playfull "virus". I am sure that I coded this ages ago. It was in 2019 I believe. 
I repeat THE OWNERS OF THE VIRUS ARE NOT INVOLVED and I don't want to get in trouble.
Read the LICENSE file in this directory.

Cox
